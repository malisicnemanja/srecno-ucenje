## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

---

## üìù Next Steps (PHASE 3)

### Before Starting PHASE 3:
1. **Test in Sanity Studio**
   - Verify all 3 new types appear
   - Confirm old types still work
   - Create test documents (as drafts only)

2. **Review Migration Plan**
   - Check `MIGRATION-PLAN-PHASE-2.md`
   - Confirm transformation logic
   - Plan execution order

3. **Backup Current State**
   - Create new Git branch
   - Export current CMS data
   - Document any manual content

### PHASE 3 Will Include:
1. Execute migrations (copy, not move)
2. Update pages to use new components
3. Create redirect middleware
4. Test all functionality
5. Clean up deprecated files (finally!)

## üö® Important Reminders

- **DO NOT DELETE** any old schemas yet
- **DO NOT EXECUTE** migrations in PHASE 2
- **TEST CAREFULLY** in Sanity Studio
- All changes are still reversible

**PHASE 2 successfully prepared the CMS for future migration without breaking anything!**
