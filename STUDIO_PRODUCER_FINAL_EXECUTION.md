- Non-franchise testimonials diluting brand message

**This cleanup MUST happen before any other development work can proceed.**

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

As Studio Producer, you must coordinate these agents in sequence:

### **PHASE 1A: DevOps Automator (CRITICAL - 30 minutes)**
**Agent**: `devops-automator`  
**Task**: Execute Sanity CMS cleanup immediately  

```bash
# COMMANDS FOR DEVOPS AUTOMATOR:
export SANITY_API_TOKEN="[WRITE-TOKEN-NEEDED]"
cd "/Users/nemanjamalisic/Desktop/srecno-ucenje 2/sanity-exports/backup-2025-08-07T21-59-23-965Z"

# Step 1: Validation (MANDATORY)
node validate-cleanup.js

# Step 2: Execute cleanup (if validation passes)
node safe-sanity-cleanup.js

# Step 3: Verify success
node validate-cleanup.js
```

**Success Criteria:**
- 46 items successfully deleted
- Zero reference errors
- Clean Sanity Studio interface
- Cleanup log shows 100% success

### **PHASE 1B: Backend Architect (60 minutes)**
**Agent**: `backend-architect`  
**Task**: Execute schema migration after cleanup  

```bash
# COMMANDS FOR BACKEND ARCHITECT:
cd "/Users/nemanjamalisic/Desktop/srecno-ucenje 2"

# Execute prepared migration
node scripts/migration/run-migration.js

# Verify schema consolidation: 81 → 18

### **PHASE 3: Test Writer + UX Researcher (2 hours)**
