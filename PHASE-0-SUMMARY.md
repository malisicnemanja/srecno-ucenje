6. **CMS Backup** ❌

   - This is critical before proceeding to PHASE 1

---

## 📋 Discovered Issues

### 1. Component Duplication
- **Home components exist in 3 versions:**
  - `components/home/*` (13 files) - ACTIVE ✅
  - `components/cms/*` (13 files) - OLD ❌
  - `components/features/cms/*` (6 files) - OLDER ❌

### 2. Content Mismatches
- **Experiences page** shows travel content instead of franchisee testimonials
- **Locations** should be renamed to "Centers" with individual pages

### 3. Static vs Dynamic Content
- 11 pages still use static content
- Some critical pages (calculators, quiz, booking form) need CMS integration

---

## 🎯 Recommendations Before PHASE 1

1. **Complete CMS Backup** (CRITICAL)
   - Get Sanity credentials
   - Run export command
   - Verify backup file created

2. **Capture Screenshots** (IMPORTANT)
   - Either use manual method via helper page
   - Or run the bash script if Chrome/Chromium available
   - Store in `/screenshots-backup/` folder

3. **Review Findings**
   - Check `content-inventory-detailed.json` for all issues
   - Verify no critical pages were missed
   - Confirm migration strategy aligns with findings
