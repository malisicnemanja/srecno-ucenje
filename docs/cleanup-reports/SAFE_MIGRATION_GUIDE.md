# Safe Sanity Migration Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for safely migrating your Sanity content without any risk of data loss.

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Read This First

**THIS MIGRATION IS DESIGNED TO BE COMPLETELY SAFE:**
- ✅ No existing data will be overwritten
- ✅ All content is backed up before any changes
- ✅ New franchise documents are created alongside existing content
- ✅ Complete rollback capability if needed
- ✅ Verification at every step

## Prerequisites

### 1. Environment Setup

Ensure you have:
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Access to Sanity project (Project ID: 08ctxj6y)
- Write permissions to the Sanity dataset

### 2. API Token

1. Go to [Sanity Management Console](https://sanity.io/manage)
2. Select your project (08ctxj6y)
3. Navigate to API → Tokens
4. Create a new token with **Editor** permissions (read + write)
5. Set the token in your environment:

```bash
export SANITY_API_TOKEN="your_token_here"
```

### 3. Verify Setup

```bash
# Test your environment
npm run migration:export --dry-run
```

## Migration Process

### Option 1: Automated Migration (Recommended)

Run the complete migration process with guidance:

```bash
npm run migration:full
```

This will:
1. Check your environment
2. Export all existing content
3. Analyze the content structure  
4. Create new franchise documents
5. Verify everything worked correctly
6. Generate detailed reports

**Estimated time: 20-35 minutes**

### Option 2: Manual Step-by-Step

If you prefer to run each step manually:

#### Step 1: Export Content
```bash
npm run migration:export
```
**What it does:** Creates complete JSON backup of all existing content
**Time:** 3-5 minutes
**Output:** `/sanity-exports/backup-[timestamp]/`

#### Step 2: Analyze Content
```bash
npm run migration:analyze
```
**What it does:** Analyzes content structure and creates migration plan
**Time:** 2-3 minutes
**Output:** Analysis reports in the export directory

#### Step 3: Review Analysis
**IMPORTANT:** Review these files before proceeding:
- `EXPORT_SUMMARY.md` - Overview of exported content
- `MIGRATION_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md` - Detailed migration plan
- `CONTENT_ANALYSIS.json` - Raw analysis data

#### Step 4: Safe Migration
```bash
npm run migration:safe-migrate
```
**What it does:** Creates new franchise documents without touching existing data
**Time:** 5-10 minutes
**Output:** Migration results and new document references

#### Step 5: Verification
```bash
npm run migration:verify
```
**What it does:** Verifies all data was migrated correctly
**Time:** 2-3 minutes
**Output:** Verification report confirming data integrity

## What Gets Migrated

### New Document Types Created

The migration creates these new document types for your franchise system:

1. **`school`** - Physical franchise locations
   - Created from: `locationData` 
   - Contains: Address, contact info, status, capacity

2. **`franchisePackage`** - Franchise offering packages
   - Created from: `program` documents
   - Contains: Pricing, features, investment details

3. **`modernFranchiseFAQ`** - Enhanced FAQ system
   - Created from: `faq` documents
   - Contains: Categorized questions, tags, priorities

4. **`franchiseModelsPage`** - Main franchise page
   - Created from: `homePage` content
   - Contains: Hero sections, statistics, packages

5. **`howToJoinPage`** - Franchise application process
   - Created from: generic `page` content
   - Contains: Step-by-step process, requirements

### Existing Content

**ALL EXISTING CONTENT REMAINS UNTOUCHED**
- Your original blog posts, testimonials, FAQs, etc. stay exactly the same
- The new franchise documents are created alongside existing content
- No references or relationships are broken

## Expected Results

After successful migration, you'll have:

### Original Content (Preserved)
- 17 blog posts → Unchanged
- 51 testimonials → Unchanged  
- 49 FAQs → Unchanged (+ new modernFranchiseFAQ versions)
- 8 books → Unchanged
- All other content → Unchanged

### New Franchise Content (Created)
- ~12 school documents (from locationData)
- ~3-5 franchisePackage documents (from programs)
- Enhanced FAQ system with categorization
- Dedicated franchise landing pages
- Complete franchise application flow

### Total Document Increase
- Before: ~200 documents
- After: ~250+ documents
- **Zero data loss, only additions**

## Safety Features

### 1. Complete Backup
Every document is exported to JSON files with full metadata before any changes.

### 2. Non-Destructive Migration
New documents are created with unique IDs. No existing documents are modified.

### 3. Verification System
Every step is verified with detailed reporting of what was created vs. expected.

### 4. Rollback Capability
If needed, new documents can be safely removed using the migration metadata.

### 5. Progress Tracking
Detailed logs track every operation with timestamps and results.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "SANITY_API_TOKEN not found"
```bash
# Make sure token is set correctly
echo $SANITY_API_TOKEN
export SANITY_API_TOKEN="your_token_here"
```

#### "Connection failed"
- Check internet connection
- Verify token has correct permissions
- Ensure project ID is correct (08ctxj6y)

#### "Export directory not found"
Run the export step first:
```bash
npm run migration:export
```

#### "Migration failed partway through"
The scripts are designed to be safe to re-run:
- Already migrated documents will be skipped
- You can resume from any point
- Check the log files for specific errors

### Getting Help

1. **Check the log files** in `/sanity-exports/backup-[timestamp]/`
2. **Review error messages** in the terminal output
3. **Examine the verification report** to understand what succeeded/failed

## Post-Migration Steps

### 1. Verify in Sanity Studio

1. Open Sanity Studio: `http://localhost:3000/studio`
2. Check the new document types:
   - Schools
   - Franchise Packages  
   - Modern Franchise FAQs
   - Franchise Pages

### 2. Test Website Functionality

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Test franchise pages:
   - `/fransiza-modeli` - Franchise models
   - `/kako-se-pridruziti` - How to join
   - `/fransiza/prijava` - Application form

### 3. Update Any Necessary References

The migration creates new documents but doesn't automatically update references in pages. You may need to:
- Link new franchise packages to the models page
- Update navigation if needed
- Connect FAQs to appropriate pages

### 4. Deploy When Ready

Once you've verified everything works:
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to remove the migrated documents:

### Quick Rollback (Sanity Studio)
1. Go to Vision tool in Sanity Studio
2. Run this query to find migrated documents:
```groq
*[defined(metadata.migrationDate) && metadata.migrationDate >= "2024-08-07"]
```
3. Delete the documents you want to remove

### Programmatic Rollback
```bash
# This would require a custom script
# All migrated documents have metadata.migrationDate
```
